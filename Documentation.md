# Non-govermental Emissary For Exploration, Research and Unification (NEFERU)

### Background
>*The team of Project NEFERU is seeking out experienced freelance programmers to help create the internal system for our exploration vessels. The project consists of the central server software as well as remote client applications which will allow the onboard crew to interface with the server. The contestant behind the winning entry will recieve an account bonus of 3000000 CR to be redeemed at any licenced vendor of the International Corporate Union.*

### System entities
- **Mainframe** - The main server of the ship. Provides computational power and interfaces with client interfaces.
- **Terminal** - Default graphical client app. Allows authorized users to communicate with the mainframe.
- **Database** - Local databank for preserving research data and system logs.
- **Sensors** - Input devices for monitoring ship subsystems.

### Functional Requirements
- **Subsystem Monitoring** - The system should monitor the status of all ship subsystems, such as propulsion, life support systems, communication, etc., and alert the crew in case of malfunctions or abnormalities.

- **Resource Management** - We need the ability to efficiently manage resources such as energy, water, air, and others to ensure the continuity of the crew's operation throughout the mission.

- **Research Data Analysis** - The system should collect, analyze, and present data from exploration missions, such as images, measurements, samples, etc., supporting our research and exploration activities.

- **Communication and Navigation** - Support for internal crew communication and communication with ground stations. The system should also support precise navigation in challenging space conditions.

- **Security Systems** - Protection against external and internal threats, including safeguards against accidents, failures, cyber-attacks, etc.

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Intuitive User Interface** - The system interface should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing for efficient menu navigation through capacitive touch input.

- **Multi-level Access Authorization** - Providing different levels of access to the system according to the role and permissions of individual crew members.

- **Flexibility and Scalability** - The system should be flexible and easily scalable to adapt to different types of missions and changing crew needs as well as augumentation through new sensors and terminals.

- **Reliability** - The system should be resilient to errors and malfunctions, providing data backups and self diagnostic and repair mechanisms.

- **Data Availability** - Ensuring data availability in real-time and the ability to work offline in case of loss of connectivity with external systems.
